In this paper , we will describe a search tool for a huge set of ngrams . The tool supports queries with an arbitrary number of wildcards . It takes a fraction of a second for a search , and can provide the fillers of the wildcards . The system runs on a single Linux PC with reasonable size memory ( less than 4 GB ) and disk space ( less than 400 GB ) . This system can be a very useful tool for linguistic knowledge discovery and other NLP tasks .
